# AIML Projects

This repository is a collection of **AIML / AI-DS mini projects** created as part of my learning journey.

It will be continuously updated with new mini projects in the future as I enhance my knowledge and skills in **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science** through hands-on practice.

Each project focuses on applying concepts practically while following clean coding and version control practices.
