# Global Air Quality Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes global air quality data using Python and Pandas to identify pollution patterns at country and city levels.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 18,000+ records with air quality metrics such as PM2.5 and AQI collected across multiple cities worldwide.

## Key Steps
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (AQI categories, PM2.5 levels, high pollution flag)
- Country-wise and city-wise pollution analysis
- Basic data visualization

## Key Insights
- PM2.5 pollution is consistently high across several major cities.
- AQI-based categories do not always align with PM2.5 levels, indicating multiple pollution contributors.
- Certain countries show higher average pollution levels compared to others.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (via Pandas)
